    <h1>About Me</h1> 
   <img src="../Picture/Profile.jpg">
    <p>Hi, my name is Jonathan Böttcher, I was born in 1999 in Berlin, but spent most of my adolescence in Southwest Germany 
        between the Cities Of Freiburg and Lörrach.
        I came in contact with Music Production at the Age of 14 and started DJing at the age of 18.
        At that time I also discovered Psytrance and started to organise my own small Events.
        I am a trained Car Mechanic, but my Heart beats for the Music.
        Currently I am Studying Media Conception at Hochschule Furtwangen.
